This project is divided into two part:

1. **LNC controller**  
	In this part, Socket *C++ (**Server**)interface* should be combined with LNC controller.
2. **Database**  
	We use *Python* for building Datebase, and the data received from **Socket client** will be updated and upload to the database.
